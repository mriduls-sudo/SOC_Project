Title: How well can the world’s irrigation canals be observed by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Satellite Mission?
Members: Mridul S, Quan T
Irrigation and engineered canal networks are critical components of global water management, yet their monitoring remains challenging due to their narrow widths and spatial complexity. This project assesses the capability of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite to observe canals at the global scale using geospatial data analysis techniques. Leveraging the Global River and Irrigation Network (GRAIN) dataset as a global reference for canal geometry, we develop an automated processing pipeline that integrates SWOT pixel-level observations with topographic data to evaluate canal observability. The analysis is implemented using Python-based geospatial libraries including xarray, geopandas, shapely, rasterio, pyproj, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. We introduce a confidence-based framework that quantifies the reliability of SWOT observations along canals using multiple spatial and statistical metrics. As part of this course project, we will complete the global analysis, produce spatial datasets and visualizations of canal observability, and derive insights into how canal geometry and environmental context influence satellite-based surface water monitoring.
