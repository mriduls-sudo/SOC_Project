# 🇺🇸 SWOT Irrigation Canal Observability — United States

**Course Project**  
**Mridul S, Quan T**



## Project Title

**How Well Can Irrigation Canals in the United States Be Observed by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Satellite Mission?**



## Overview

Irrigation canals are critical components of water delivery systems across the United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. However, monitoring these narrow, engineered networks at large spatial scales remains challenging.

This project evaluates how effectively the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission can observe irrigation canals across the continental United States (CONUS).

Using canal geometry from the Global River and Irrigation Network (GRAIN) dataset and satellite-derived surface water observations, we assess canal detectability and generate spatial observability maps for the United States.



## Objectives

- Assess SWOT’s capability to detect irrigation canals in the United States.  
- Develop a structured workflow for large-scale geospatial analysis.  
- Generate spatial datasets and visualizations of canal observability.  
- Identify geographic patterns and regional differences in detectability.  



## Study Area

- Continental United States (CONUS)  
- Focus on irrigation-intensive regions (e.g., Western U.S., High Plains)  



## Project Outputs

- Canal-level observability metrics  
- State and regional summary statistics  
- Detection confidence maps for CONUS  
- Visualizations illustrating spatial patterns of canal detectability
