🇺🇸 SWOT Irrigation Canal Observability — United States
Course Project
Mridul S, Quan T

Project Title
How Well Can Irrigation Canals in the United States Be Observed by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) Satellite Mission?

Overview
Irrigation canals are essential components of water delivery systems across the United States, particularly in water-scarce regions. However, monitoring these narrow, engineered networks at large spatial scales remains challenging.
This project evaluates how effectively the Surface Water and Ocean Topography can observe irrigation canals across the continental United States (CONUS).
Using canal geometry from the Global River and Irrigation Network and satellite-derived surface water observations, we develop a systematic processing workflow to assess canal detectability and generate spatial observability maps for the U.S.

Study Area
Continental United States (CONUS)
Focus on irrigation-intensive regions (e.g., Western U.S., High Plains)

Objectives
Assess the capability of SWOT to detect and measure irrigation canals in the U.S.
Develop a structured processing workflow for large-scale analysis.
Generate spatial datasets and visualizations of canal observability.
Identify geographic patterns and regional differences in detectability.

Outputs
Canal-level observability metrics
State and regional summary statistics
Detection confidence maps for CONUS
Visualizations illustrating spatial patterns of canal detectability
